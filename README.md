## Project Description
WeatherApp is a web application designed to provide users with real-time weather information based on the city name they enter. The application fetches weather data from a reliable weather API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. The goal of the project is to create an intuitive and responsive weather application that helps users stay informed about current weather conditions.


### Features
City-Based Weather Search: Users can enter the name of a city to retrieve the current weather information for that location.  
Real-Time Data: The application fetches the latest weather data from a weather API, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.  
Detailed Weather Information: Displays key weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).  
Responsive Design: The application is designed to be accessible and functional on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.  
Error Handling: Provides meaningful error messages for invalid city names or network issues.  


### Technologies Used
JavaScript: Handles the logic for fetching weather data from the API, processing the data, and updating the user interface dynamically.  
HTML: Structures the content of the application, including input fields, buttons, and weather information display.  
CSS: Styles the application to create an appealing and user-friendly interface, with responsive design principles.  
Weather API: Integrates with a reliable weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack) to fetch real-time weather data.  


### How It Works
User Input: The user enters the name of a city in the input field and clicks the "Search" or "Enter" button.  
Fetch Weather Data: JavaScript sends a request to the weather API with the entered city name to retrieve the current weather information.  
Display Weather Information: The application processes the received data and displays the weather details on the screen, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.  
Error Handling: If the entered city name is invalid or there is a network issue, the application displays an appropriate error message to the user.  


### Additional Features
User-Friendly Interface: Create an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for retrieving weather information.  
Accurate Data: Ensure the application provides accurate and up-to-date weather information by integrating with a reliable weather API.
